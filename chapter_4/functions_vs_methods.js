// FUNCTIONS VS METHODS

const firstName = 'Bob';

// Functions

const greet = () => 'Hello';

let resultOne = greet();
console.log(resultOne);


// Methods

let resultTwo = firstName.toUpperCase();
console.log(resultTwo);


// Methods are functions that are associated with an object.
// Functions are functions that are not associated with an object.
