# Notes

- VSCode Extensions
	- Live Server - Allows you to preview a webiste in your browser.
	- Mateiral Icon Theme - Makes the files in the file dock look better.
	- Monokai++ - A theme for VSCode text.
- `let`, `const` & `var`
    - `const` makes a variable immutable.
    - `let` declares a mutable variable in block scope.
    - `var` declares a mutable variable in global scope.
        - `var` is not used as often anymore. `const` and `let` are considered better practice.
- **Types in JavaScript**
    - **Number:** 1, 2, 3, etc.
    - **String:** "hello world:
    - **Boolean:** true/false
    - **Null:** Has no value.
    - **Undefined:** For variables that have not yet been defined.
    - **Object:** Data structures such as arrays, etc.
    - **Symbol:** Used with objects, but aren't objects.
- JavaScript is a "loosely-typed" language.
    - Java and C# are strongly-typed.
- Function != Method
    - Methods are associated with objects while functions are not.

- Order of Operations
    - PEMDAS = Parentheses, Exponents, Multiplication, Division, Addition, then Subtraction
